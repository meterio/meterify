## Meterify &nbsp;&nbsp;

A web3 adaptor for Meter [Meter] RESTful API.

> **⚠ WARNING: Specific version of web3.js required.**  
> This implementation is supposed to work with web3.js version lower than **v1.2.4**. Please be aware it does **NOT** work well with web3.js v1.3.0, there are some known issues that we are still figuring out.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save meterify
npm install --save web3@1.*   # Web3 is needed as dependency.
```

## Usage

```javascript
// ES6 style
import { meterify } from "meterify";
const Web3 = require("web3"); // Recommend using require() instead of import here

const web3 = meterify(new Web3(), "http://localhost:8669");

web3.eth.getBlock("latest").then(res => console.log(res));
// Best block info will be displayed
```

If you would like to write code in ES5, check below for the initialization code.

```javascript
// ES5 style
const meterify = require("meterify").meterify;
const Web3 = require("web3");

const web3 = meterify(new Web3(), "http://localhost:8669");

web3.eth.getBlock("latest").then(res => console.log(res));
// Best block info will be displayed
```

## Send Transaction

In Meter official implementation , the client **DOES NOT** neither manage user's private-key/keyStore nor use private key to sign a Transaction. Unfortunately, meterify can not directly perform `eth_sendTransaction` but there is another way to sign a transaction.

In [web3.js accounts](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-accounts.html#eth-accounts), it gives the opportunity to add your private-key, stored in your runtime context (In Node.js context, it's stored in memory while in Browser context, it's stored in memory/local storage), to accounts module. When you are trying to send a transaction, the module will check the private key associated with from field. Once the private key and from have been matched, the module will sign the transaction.
The APIs that follows the mechanism are:

- `web3.eth.sendTransaction()`
- `contract.deploy.send()`
- `contract.methods.myMethod.send()`

## Documentation

## Play with multi-clause

1. [@meterio/devkit](https://github.com/meterio/devkit) supports multi-clause and sign transaction

## Which Stack Should I Choose Regarding Connex,Meterify And Web3-Gear

- [Connex](https://github.com/meterio/flex): The standard interface to connect Dapps with Meter blockchain and user.

If you are writing some application or scripts executing in `Node.js` or `Browser` environment, you should use `Meterify`.

Here are some most common scenarios:

1. Develop a web application(**Recommend**): `Connex` + [Connex powered Meter wallets](https://meter.io/)
2. Backend service in Node.js: `Meterify + Web3`
3. Contract development in [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/): `Web3 + Web3-Gear`
4. Contract development in [Remix-IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/): `Web3 + Web3-Gear`

## FAQ

### Method not supported

The RESTful API of Meter is different with Ethereum's JSON-RPC, therefore, there are some methods in web3 are not supported by meterify, feel free to open an issue discuss the features.

There is a possibility that when you trying to call `sendTransaction` or `send` functions, meterify will return `Method not supported` under version 0.3.1, due to account module will check the private key associated with `from` field. After upgrade to version 0.3.1 or newer, meterify will show `The private key corresponding to from filed can't be found in local eth.accounts.wallet` to make an error more specific.

## Notes

- There are three special block number in Ethereum: `earliest`,`latest`,`pending`. In Meter, we introduced `best` block and there is no `pending` block, so they will be replaced with `0` (aka genesis), `best`, `best`

## Compatibility

Currently, `meterify` is compatible with `web3@1.*`.

## Debugging

```shell
DEBUG=meter:* ts-node index.ts
```

`ts-node index.ts` can be replaced with command to run your code, this example is only for Node.js environment. For more detailed info, please refer to [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug).
